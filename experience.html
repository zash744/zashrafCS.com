        <li class="exp">Software Developer Intern(Mobile Applications) at Senseonics from June 2024 to August 2024</li>
        <p class="exp-description">Developed a mobile app that used an Image Recognition API to identify over 20,000 foods from meal photos, 
            store data in an S3 bucket, and log meal events with glucose levels in an AGP report, providing insights for patients and clinicians.
            <br><br>
            Integrated and tested a mobile app that could host its web service, allowing separate devices to connect and turn on/off NFC scanning, 
            and return all NFC tags scanned via endpoints, resulting in the handling of over 100 unique NFC tags.
            <br><br>
            Performed automated testing on AWS Device Farm, reducing mobile device testing costs by approximately 40% by eliminating the need for physical 
            device purchases and maintenance.
