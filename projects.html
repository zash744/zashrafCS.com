        <p class="exp-description">This mobile application makes it easier to log and track their meals, especially if the meals they consume are repetitive. It allows users 
            to take a picture of their meal and the app will recognize the meal and log specific nutritional data for them.
             Designed a Flutter/Dart app integrating an Image Recognition API to recognize meals, recording 150+ events and providing key insights into glucose 
            levels for health monitoring.

        <li class="exp">Full Stack Fantasy Football Stat Web Application</li>
        <p class="exp-description">In this web application, a user can see all the important stats regarding a player in fantasy football to help them draft their team and win their league! 
            This application uses React for the front end and Java Spring Boot for the backend to provide fantasy football players with access to 
            approximately 12,000 NFL statistics, utilizing data scraping and storing information in a MySQL database.

        <li class="exp">Full Stack Web Application for Streaming Availability</li>
        <p class="exp-description">In this web application, a user can enter any show or movie and this web application will 
            tell the user what platform the show or movie can be found on and will store their entries in a database. So many people hear about new shows or movies but don't know
            if they are able to watch it platforms that they may subsribe to. With this, they can find out easily. This was done in HTML, CSS, Javascript(Node.js), 
            and MongoDB.

            As you spot a hitchhiker on the side, immerse yourself in a gripping tale where your choices 
            steer the narrative, leading to diverse outcomes as you navigate the complexities of trust, 
            curiosity, and human connection. Along the way, I also delved into the basics of Swift, 
            enabling me to implement dynamic UI changes that mirror your decisions and intensify the 
            immersive storytelling experience.

        <li class="exp">Weather App Prototype</li>
        <p class="exp-description">Introducing my weather app prototype, a compact yet powerful tool 
            that brings you real-time weather updates with a sleek and intuitive interface. 
            With a focus on simplicity and accuracy, this app provides essential weather information at a glance, 
            helping you plan your day seamlessly. During the development process, I honed my Swift skills further, 
            delving into advanced techniques such as retrieving and parsing data from JSON sources. 
            This allowed me to create a dynamic app that not only displays weather conditions
             but also reflects my evolving expertise in Swift programming.
